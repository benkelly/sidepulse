## Installation

1. Extract the ZIP for your model on your computer.
2. Connect your device and open its drive: `PulseDot` for SidePulse Dot or
   `SidePulse` for SidePulse Pro.
3. Copy only `FIRMWARE.BIN` to the top level of the drive. Choose Replace if the
   file already exists.
4. After copying finishes, leave the device connected and untouched for at least
   10 seconds while it applies the update and restarts.
5. Reconnect the device, then open `STATUS.TXT` and check that `app_version`
   (Dot) or `release_version` (Pro) matches the version you downloaded, such as
   `1.1.0`. Reconnecting avoids a cached copy of `STATUS.TXT` on your computer.

Do not rename `FIRMWARE.BIN` or copy the ZIP itself onto the drive. The other files
in each ZIP are for reference. Normal copy/paste updates require a writable drive;
read-only storage policies may prevent this installation method.
